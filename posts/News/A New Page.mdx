I am excited to announce the new "News" page to the BitBytes blog! This area will be for announcments and news about projects I am working on, my thoughts on trends, and much more!

While the "Articles" and "Questions" pages will remain more on the educational and informative side, the "News" page will be more for updates and announcements!
