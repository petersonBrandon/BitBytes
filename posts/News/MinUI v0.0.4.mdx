I wanted to give an update on the component library I am working on, MinUI.

First, what is MinUI? Well, it is a simple component library with a minimalistic design that I am working on. While it is primarily for me to learn how to better isolate and containerize components as well as learn about NPM packages, I hope it can be useful to others as well!

The library is in very early development at the moment consisting of only five components. However, I have already learned so much with only doing a few of the components!

The current components available are:

- Alert
- Avatar
- Button
- Dropdown
- TextInput

If you want to experiment with these components, you can install the package using

```bash
npm install @petersonBrandon/minui@latest
```

For usage examples and details on these components you can visit the documentation [here](https://github.com/petersonBrandon/MinUI/wiki)
